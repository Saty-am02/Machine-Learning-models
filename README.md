## Models

### SLR 

Simple Linear Regression (SLR)
A type of linear regression for a machine learning algorithm known as simple linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable.

### DT 
Decision trees (DT) 
are among the most popular machine learning algorithms given their intelligibility and simplicity. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making.

### LOGESTIC 

Logistic regression (LR)
is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for classification tasks where the goal is to predict the probability that an instance of belonging to a given class.

### NB 

The Na√Øve Bayes (NB)
classifier is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks such as text classification. It belongs to the family of generative learning algorithms, which means that it models the distribution of inputs for a given class or category.

### SVM 

Support Vector Machine  (SVM)
is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.

### KMEANS 

K-Means 
Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning or data science. In this topic, we will learn what is K-means clustering algorithm, how the algorithm works, along with the Python implementation of k-means clustering.

### KNN 

K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) 
is one of the most basic yet essential classification algorithms in Machine Learning. It belongs to the supervised learning domain and finds intense application in pattern recognition, data mining, and intrusion detection.

### PCA 

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
is used to visualize multidimensional data. It is used to reduce the number of dimensions in healthcare data. PCA can help resize an image. It can be used in finance to analyze stock data and forecast returns.

### ENSAMBLES 

Ensemble 
methods are techniques that create multiple models and then combine them to produce improved results. Ensemble methods in machine learning usually produce more accurate solutions than a single model would.



## Usage
